    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mac and Cheese is a classic comfort food made with tender macaroni pasta and a creamy cheese sauce. It's a favorite dish for all ages and perfect for any occasion.</p>  
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li> 
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup breadcrumbs (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>Cook the elbow macaroni according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, whisk in the flour and cook for about 1-2 minutes until it forms a roux (a thick paste).</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk in the milk, ensuring there are no lumps. Continue to cook and stir until the mixture thickens, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the shredded cheddar cheese until melted and smooth. Season with salt, black pepper, and paprika (if using).</li>
        <li>Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce and stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>If you like a crispy topping, transfer the mac and cheese to a baking dish, sprinkle with breadcrumbs, and bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown on top. If not, you can serve it directly from the saucepan.</li>
        <li>Let the mac and cheese cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
